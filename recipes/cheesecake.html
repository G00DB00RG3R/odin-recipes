    <h1>Cheesecake</h1>
    <img src="../images/cheesecake.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cheesecake is a sweet dessert made with a soft fresh cheese (typically cottage cheese, cream cheese, quark or ricotta), eggs, and sugar. It may have a crust or base made from crushed cookies (or digestive biscuits), graham crackers, pastry, or sometimes sponge cake. Cheesecake may be baked or unbaked, and is usually refrigerated.</p>
    <p>Vanilla, spices, lemon, chocolate, pumpkin, or other flavors may be added to the main cheese layer. Additional flavors and visual appeal may be added by topping the finished dessert with fruit, whipped cream, nuts, cookies, fruit sauce, chocolate syrup, or other ingredients.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Crust</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>150g of graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>28g of confectioners sugars</li>
        <li>85 of melted butter</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>452g of cream cheese at room temperature</li>
        <li>133g of granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 tsp of vanille extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Select a pie whose inside top dimension is at least 9", and whose height is at least 1 1/4". Preheat the oven to 350° F.</li>
        <li><strong>To make the crust:</strong> Stir together all of the crust ingredients, mixing until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li><strong>To make the filling:</strong>Mix together the room-temperature cream, cheese and sugar until smooth. Mix in the eggs and vanilla, again mixing until smooth. To avoid beating too much air into the batter, use a mixer set at low-medium speed. To avoid lumps, make sure the cream cheese is softened, and/or at room temperature.</li>
        <li>Set the pie pan onto a baking sheet, if desired; this makes it easier to transport in and out of the oven, and also protects the bottom of the crust from any potential scorching. Pour the filling into the crust.</li>
        <li><strong>To bake the cheesecake:</strong>Place the cheesecake in the oven. Bake it for 20 minutes, then add a crust shield; or shield the crust with strips of aluminum. Bake for an additional 10 minutes (for a total of about 30 minutes). A digital thermometer inserted into the filling 1" from the edge should read between 165°F and 170°F; the filling won't look entirely set in the center.</li>
        <li>Remove the cheesecake from the oven and set it on a rack to cool. Once the cake is cool, refrigerate it, covered until you're ready to serve.</li>
    </ol>
