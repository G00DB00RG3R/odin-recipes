    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>vernight oats are raw oats that have been soaked overnight in liquid: popular choices include almond milk, hemp milk, coconut milk or Greek yogurt. While old fashioned oats are the most common type to use, you can also use steel cut oats, quick oats, or whatever else you have on hand.</p>
    <p>he oats absorb the liquid during the night, softening them in the same way cooking them softens them, except without the work! You can soak pretty much any variety of oats, although quick cook or rolled oats are often preferred because they absorb the liquid faster than, say, steel cut oats.</p>
